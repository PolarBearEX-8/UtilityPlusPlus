## Configuration
`config.yml` is created on first run with sensible defaults.

- `spawn`: controls first-join, death, no-respawn-point, cooldown, and warmup behavior.
- `random-respawn`: enables random death respawns and controls radius, attempts, and target world.
- `unsafe-blocks`: lists blocks that random respawn should avoid.
- `join-message` and `leave-message`: control custom join/quit text, vanilla hiding, and broadcast behavior.
- `bedrock-coordinates`: shows integer Bukkit block coordinates in the action bar for Floodgate usernames starting with `.`. The format supports `{x}`, `{y}`, and `{z}`.
- `death-message`: controls custom death-message formatting and colors.
- `tab-list`: configures header/footer lines and refresh interval.
- `broadcast`: sets the prefix used by `/bc` and `/broadcast`.
- `announcement.action-bar`: controls the repeating action-bar announcement. `text` can be a string or a list of texts shown in sequence.
- `queue.message`: stores queue text used by queue-style output.

Color formatting uses `&` codes and is rendered through Adventure components.
